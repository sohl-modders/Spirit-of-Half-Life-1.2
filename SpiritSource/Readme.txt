Spirit of Half-Life version 1.1
Source code release 2/11/03

(wow, should I be scared that the last source release was almost a
year ago?)

Basically, this is Spirit 1.0, ported to the HLSDK version 2.3 by
Codiac.
There are a couple of Dark Truths features added here, along with a
few minor bug fixes both by Gollum and me.
