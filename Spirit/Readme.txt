Spirit 1.0 Mod Skeleton.
This skeleton is designed to let you release your levels for Spirit with a minimum of hassle. When you're ready to release a level, follow these steps:

1) Put all your .bsp files into the "maps" folder.
2) Open up the liblist.gam file in a text editor (for example, Notepad) and follow the instructions it gives.
3) Rename this folder, from "skeleton" to something more appropriate for your levels.
4) Start up Half-Life, check that your mod appears on the Custom Game screen, and make sure the levels run ok.
5) Delete this readme.txt file. You may wish to replace it with one of your own.
6) Zip up the "skeleton" folder (or whatever you've renamed it to). You're now ready to distribute the zip file.

Of course you can do more things, like add new menu graphics etc, but this is the minimum you'll need.
